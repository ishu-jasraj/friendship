          Friendship is one of the greatest bonds anyone can ever wish for.
          Lucky are those who have friends they can trust. Friendship is a
          devoted relationship between two individuals. They both feel immense
          care and love for each other. Usually, a friendship is shared by two
          people who have similar interests and feelings.

          closest ones become our friends. You may have a
          <strong>l</strong>arge <strong>f</strong>riend <strong>c</strong>ircle
          in school or college, but you know you can only count on one or two
          people with whom you share true friendship.
